from blogging. One barrier that stood out to me was: it’s hard to identify
which things you know will be useful to other people!
The process I use for a lot of my blog posts is:
Struggle with something (usually computer-related)
Eventually (days or months or years later), figure out how to solve some of
the problems I had
Write a blog post about what helped me
I think this approach is effective because if I struggled with something,
there’s a pretty good chance that other people are struggling with it too, and
what I learned is likely to be useful to at least some of them!
Obviously this isn’t the only approach to blogging, but it’s my approach, so

understand exactly how the stack works or how to look at it.
So here’s a quick walkthrough of how you can use gdb to look at the stack of a C

C because I find it a little simpler for a toy example and also you can do Terrible
Things in C more easily.

Here’s a simple C program that declares a few variables and reads two strings
from standard input. One of the strings is on the heap, and one is on the
stack.

A river of words later, written but more often rewritten, I’m pretty sure of the contrary: programming big systems and writing novels have many common traits and similar processes.

The most obvious parallel between the two activities is that in both of them you write something. Code is not prose written in a natural language, yet it has a set of fixed rules (a grammar), certain forms that most programmers will understand as natural and others that, while formally correct, will sound hard to grasp.
There is, however, a much deeper connection between the two activities: a good program and a good novel are both the sum of local and global e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[libdivide is fish’s library for speeding up integer division by runtime constants. It works by replacing divide instructions with cheaper multiplications and shifts.
libdivide supports SIMD, and recently gained support for AVX-512 and ARM NEON. Let’s benchmark on an Intel Xeon and Apple’s M1.
Test Setup
The microbenchmark is a sum-of-quotients function, like:
uint32_t sumq(const uint32_t *vals, size_t count, uint32_t d) {
    uint32_t sum = 0;
    for (size_t i=0; i < count; i++)
        sum += vals[i] / d; // this division is the bottleneck
    return sum;
}


The execution time of this function is dominated by the divide. It may be optimized with libdivide:
uint32_t sumq(const uint32_t *vals, size_t count, uint32_t d) {
    libdivide::divider<uint32_t> div(d);
    uint32_t sum = 0;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TCP/IP is the set of networking protocols that we use on the modern internet –
TCP, UDP, IP, ARP, ICMP, DNS, etc. When I talk about “networking”, I’m
basically always talking about TCP/IP.
Many explanations of TCP/IP start with something called the “OSI model”. I
don’t use the OSI model when explaining networking because when I first
started learning about internet networking I found all of the OSI model
explanations really confusing – it wasn’t clear to me at all how the OSI
model corresponded to TCP/IP.
So if you’re just starting to learn about networking and you’re confused about
the OSI model, here’s an explanation of how it corresponds to TCP/IP, how
it doesn’t, and why it’s safe to mostly just ignore it if you don’t find it helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the first post in a series that will be examining the historical assumptions of Paradox Interactive’s grand strategy computer game set in the early modern period, Europa Universalis IV. And this series will in turn be part of a larger series looking at several of Paradox’s games and how they treat their historical … Continue reading Collections: Teaching Paradox, Europa Universalis IV, Part I: State of Play →]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I wrote about the bits in powers of 3. That post had a low-resolution image, which has its advantages, but here’s a higher resolution image that also has its advantages. The image looks chaotic. I say this in the colloquial sense, not in the technical sense as in period three implies chaos. I just […]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The previous post showed that the bits of prime powers look kinda chaotic. When you plot them, they form a triangular shape because the size of the numbers is growing. The numbers are growing geometrically, so their binary representations are growing linearly. Here’s the plot for powers of 5: You can crop the triangle so […]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last post explored Algorithm D, and some improvements for the 3 ÷ 2 = 1 digit case. This post presents a narrowing division algorithm, improving upon the widely used “divlu” function from Hacker’s Delight. I am optimistic that these ideas are original.
divlu is a narrowing division: it divides a 4 digit number by a 2 digit number, producing a 2 digit quotient and remainder. This is achieved by specializing Algorithm D for 4-digit dividend and 2-digit divisor.
q̂ is an estimated quotient digit. It is quite close to the quotient digit q; it may be exactly the same, or larger by 1 or 2, and that’s all! The tricky parts of divlu is “correcting” q̂ to the true digit, by subtracting 0, 1, or 2.
Here is the correction step from Hacker’s Delight:

   if (q1 >= b || q1*vn0 > b*rhat + un1) {
