                    <span>I was talking to Jemma recently about what stops people
from blogging. One barrier that stood out to me was: it’s hard to identify
which things you know will be useful to other people!
The process I use for a lot of my blog posts is:
Struggle with something (usually computer-related)
Eventually (days or months or years later), figure out how to solve some of
the problems I had
Write a blog post about what helped me
I think this approach is effective because if I struggled with something,
there’s a pretty good chance that other people are struggling with it too, and
what I learned is likely to be useful to at least some of them!
Obviously this isn’t the only approach to blogging, but it’s my approach, so
that’s what I’m going to write about here :). I’ll give a few examples of

                    <span>I was chatting with someone yesterday and they mentioned that they don’t really
understand exactly how the stack works or how to look at it.
So here’s a quick walkthrough of how you can use gdb to look at the stack of a C
program. I think this would be similar for a Rust program, but I’m going to use
C because I find it a little simpler for a toy example and also you can do Terrible
Things in C more easily.
our test program
Here’s a simple C program that declares a few variables and reads two strings
from standard input. One of the strings is on the heap, and one is on the
stack.
#include 
#include 

int main() {
    char stack_string[10] &#x3D; &quot;stack&quot;;
    int x &#x3D; 10;
    char *heap_string;

    heap_string &#x3D; malloc(50);

                    <span>The most common way to quantify entropy is Shannon entropy. That’s what people usually mean when they say “entropy” without further qualifications. A while back I wrote about Renyi entropy as a generalization of Shannon entropy. This time I’ll explore a different generalization called q-log entropy, a.k.a. Tsallis entropy.

                    <span>One year ago I paused my programming life and started writing a novel, with the illusion that my new activity was deeply different than the previous one. A river of words later, written but more often rewritten, I’m pretty sure of the contrary: programming big systems and writing novels have many common traits and similar processes.

The most obvious parallel between the two activities is that in both of them you write something. Code is not prose written in a natural language, yet it has a set of fixed rules (a grammar), certain forms that most programmers will understand as natural and others that, while formally correct, will sound hard to grasp.
There is, however, a much deeper connection between the two activities: a good program and a good novel are both the sum of local and global e…</span>

                    <span>libdivide is fish’s library for speeding up integer division by runtime constants. It works by replacing divide instructions with cheaper multiplications and shifts.
libdivide supports SIMD, and recently gained support for AVX-512 and ARM NEON. Let’s benchmark on an Intel Xeon and Apple’s M1.
Test Setup
The microbenchmark is a sum-of-quotients function, like:
uint32_t sumq(const uint32_t *vals, size_t count, uint32_t d) {
    uint32_t sum &#x3D; 0;
    for (size_t i&#x3D;0; i  div(d);

                    <span>TCP/IP is the set of networking protocols that we use on the modern internet –
TCP, UDP, IP, ARP, ICMP, DNS, etc. When I talk about “networking”, I’m
basically always talking about TCP/IP.
Many explanations of TCP/IP start with something called the “OSI model”. I
don’t use the OSI model when explaining networking because when I first
started learning about internet networking I found all of the OSI model
explanations really confusing – it wasn’t clear to me at all how the OSI
model corresponded to TCP/IP.
So if you’re just starting to learn about networking and you’re confused about
the OSI model, here’s an explanation of how it corresponds to TCP/IP, how
it doesn’t, and why it’s safe to mostly just ignore it if you don’t find it helpful.
the OSI model has 7 layers

                    <span>The trace of a square matrix is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal. The order in which you multiply matrices matters: in general, matrix multiplication is not commutative. But the trace of a product of matrices may or may not depend on the order of multiplication. Specifically, trace doesn’t change if you […]

I also usually post the comics on Twitter as I write them. But there are a lot of problems with just posting them to Twitter, like:
the pages are hard to find. For example, if you want to find the one on
socat, you can search twitter
and you’ll find it, but then you have to somehow magically guess what words I
used in the tweet, and also sort through a bunch of other tweets.
they’re annoying to link to. Twitter isn’t really the best user interface for this sort of thing.
I can’t make updates. Twitter doesn’t have an edit button!
work that never made it into a zine is basically impossible to find. For example I

                    <span>The previous post looked at repeatedly applying the function s(n) which is the sum of the divisors of n less than n. It is an open question whether the sequence s( s( s( … s(n) … ) ) ) always converges or enters a loop. In fact, it’s an open question of whether the sequence […]

                    <span>Let s(n) be the sum of the proper divisors of n, the divisors less than n itself. A number n is called excessive, deficient, or perfect depending on whether s(n) – n is positive, negative, or 0 respectively, as I wrote about a few days ago. The number s(n) is called the aliquot sum of […]

The cologarithm base b is the logarithm base 1/b, or equivalently, the negative of the logarithm base b. cologb x &#x3D; log1/b x &#x3D; -logb x […]

                    <span>When students learn about decimals, they’re told that every fraction either has a terminating decimal expansion or a repeating decimal expansion. The previous post gives a constructive proof of the converse: given a repeating fraction (in any base) it shows how to find what rational number it corresponds to. Maybe you learned this so long […]

For this post I’ll explain how calculations like that are done, how to convert a repeating decimal in any base to a fraction. First of all, we only need to consider repeating decimals of the form 0.1b, 0.01b, 0.001b, […]

I say this in the colloquial sense, not in the technical sense as in period three implies chaos. I just […]

                    <span>Last post explored Algorithm D, and some improvements for the 3 ÷ 2 &#x3D; 1 digit case. This post presents a narrowing division algorithm, improving upon the widely used “divlu” function from Hacker’s Delight. I am optimistic that these ideas are original.
divlu is a narrowing division: it divides a 4 digit number by a 2 digit number, producing a 2 digit quotient and remainder. This is achieved by specializing Algorithm D for 4-digit dividend and 2-digit divisor.
q̂ is an estimated quotient digit. It is quite close to the quotient digit q; it may be exactly the same, or larger by 1 or 2, and that’s all! The tricky parts of divlu is “correcting” q̂ to the true digit, by subtracting 0, 1, or 2.
Here is the correction step from Hacker’s Delight:

                    <span>The previous post showed that the bits of prime powers look kinda chaotic. When you plot them, they form a triangular shape because the size of the numbers is growing. The numbers are growing geometrically, so their binary representations are growing linearly. Here’s the plot for powers of 5: You can crop the triangle so […]
